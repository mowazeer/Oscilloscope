My project comes second in "IMT School Online Competition", where 120 contestants presented different ideas in the first stage of the competition, then they chose 23 ideas for implementation in the second stage, then they chose the five best projects in terms of idea and implementation to the final stage.
Where each contestant submitted his project online to the viewers and the panel of judges:
-ENG. Ahmed Ashmawi, Head of Embedded Systems Department at ITI.
-ENG. Medhat Fahmy, Embedded Systems Engineer at Samsung Germany.
-ENG. Ahmed Emad, Embedded Software Engineer at Valeo Egyp.
-ENG. Mostafa Ibrahim, Senior Embedded Software Engineer at Valeo Egyp.
-ENG. Mustafa Badawi, Embedded Software Engineer at Valeo Egypt.
-ENG. Ahmed Assaf, Embedded Systems Team Leader at Valeo Egypt.
Thanks, IMT School for this competition It is a good experience and added value to all the participants.

# Oscilloscope 
The project has two main parts:  
1- Six Channel Oscilloscope that allows the user to select Time per Division and the used channel, to draws the input signal and calculates: 
  • Frequency 
  • Periodic Time 
  • (Minimum, Maximum and Average) Volt  
2- Signal generator that can generate “32 software PWM signal” with different Frequency and different Duty cycle at the same time.  
-Although I can generate the signal using: 
  • "TMU" that refers to Time management unit 
  • "SOS" that refer to a small OS or non-preemptive scheduler

## Hardware Components:
-Oscilloscope:
     • ATMEGA32
     • LCD_TFT_ili9486
     • Two Potentiometer “10k ohm”
-Signal Generator:
     • ATMEGA32
     • LED

## Target:
   * MCAL Layer for atmega32.
   * Just change the MCAL Folder with your own target.
